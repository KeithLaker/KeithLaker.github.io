				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Over the years, a lot of new features have been introduced in the Oracle Database to save developers time and to spare them from having to reinvent the wheel. Many of these features are actively highlighted via conference sessions or blogs when a new release is launched but over time are forgotten before they can be put to good use. In this session, we will discuss the critical features that already existing in the Oracle Database, which every developer should not only know about but also utilize. Using easy-to-follow examples, we will demonstrate when and where you should take advantage of these features to make your life easier and help you getting the best out of your Oracle Database, regardless of whether you are a DBA or a developer. 	<br><br>	<a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6558" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

Dozens of participants from across the business used internal Beckman data to work on their own business cases, but were guided by expert proctors. More than 30 initiatives or projects resulted directly from this effort. You’ll learn what tools and processes were used, what necessary preparation steps were taken, and how the workshop was delivered.

Datafication, smart phones, Twitter, Facebook, GPS and IoT, produce a digital exhaust that tracks your every movement, relationships and activities. Now, companies know everything about you and can anticipate your future. Peter Tucker, author of “The Naked Future” paints a vivid picture of a present and “very near future” where machine learning and “cognitive” technologies can analyze gigabytes of data and even predict your future. Oracle’s Big Data, Machine Learning, Notebooks, Clouds and “predictive” Applications make this “naked future” more real today than you may realize.

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	For decades, developers and DBAs have battled over who controls the world. As Cloud databases now free up DBAs from the mundane, the battle flares again as developers need greater flexibility, less structure and faster turnaround to deploy, whilst DBAs cling to a more methodical approach, worried about the wreckage that may result from "fast and loose". But does that just make the DBA an inhibitor to your productivity ? Who is right ? Perhaps both are ? Can developers and DBAs peacefully coexist ? Maybe they just need the right technology. In this session, using real examples, we will explain how to integrate the demands of the modern-day developer with the Oracle Database (and the modern day administrators).	<br><br>	<a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6737" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

Unfortunately, no complex software package comes without at least a small handful of unanticipated and unintended surprises, which a portion of users may encounter. In this session, we will describe tools and articles available from Support that will help you avoid common pitfalls encountered before, during, and after installing or upgrading to Oracle Database 12c Release 2. We will also talk about behavior changes from earlier releases that might be easy to miss and how to manage optimizer changes and avoid general performance issues. Material presented will be based on real-world service ticket data. 	<br><br>	<a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=Manalac&showEnrolled=false" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Oracle Database In-Memory introduces a new in-memory columnar format and a new set of SQL execution optimizations such as SIMD processing, column elimination, storage indexes, and in-memory aggregation all of which are designed specifically for the new columnar format. This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to get started with Oracle Database In-Memory, how to identify which of the optimizations are being used, and how your SQL statements benefit from them. This lab uses Oracle Database 12c Release 2 and also highlights the new features available in the latest release. Experience firsthand just how easy it is to start taking advantage of this technology and its performance improvements.	<br><br>	<a href="0" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	One of the main points of issue with upgrading an Oracle Database is how your system will be impacted by changes in the optimizer from release to release. Although tools like Workload Replay can be used for testing for changes there is not always time or resources available. This session talks about the some of the optimizer related issues that the Real World Performance Group has run into helping customers upgrade to Oracle Database 12c and how we recommend configuring the database to ensure that the we still get the benefits of optimizer improvements while minimizing risk.	<br><br>	<a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6629" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

			<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Organizations are capturing data in a variety of data stores including Oracle Database, NoSQL, and Hadoop. Oracle Big Data SQL allows you to use Oracle SQL and security policies to seamlessly query across these stores. This means that existing Oracle Database query applications—without changes—will now be able to take advantage of this new information. This hands-on lab introduces you to how this is achieved: providing access to big data sources, implementing unified security, and delivering analyses that combine and correlate all data.	<br><br>	<a href="0" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Falling demand for centralised electricity generation and greater customer choice have raised the stakes for energy utilities in Australia. EnergyAustralia has strategically leveraged Oracle R Enterprise and Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop, capabilities that are integrated into their Oracle Big Data Solution, to respond to market pressure. This approach has reduced the time-to-market for analytics data products by several orders of magnitude and enhanced throughput by a factor of 70. This session covers the organisation’s journey in data science, using Oracle’s integrated offering of Advanced Analytics and Engineered Systems, to emerge as a true market leader. Also covered are future plans to utilise the Oracle Cloud.	<br><br>	<a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON3130" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

This sessions describes the key concepts and compare Apache Hadoop versus Apache Spark versus Apache Flink versus Apache Beam. Big Data Analytics applications running on Hadoop, Spark -- and so on -- using query engines or APIs, need to access, integrate and correlate master data in Oracle database. The session also describes how to turn Oracle database tables into Hadoop or Spark data sources for direct access without moving or copying data over.

This brings significant performance improvement of analytical SQL in OLAP and OLTP mixed workload environments. Key In-Memory terminologies such as dual-format SGA architecture, In-Memory components 1MB pool and 64KB pool and their functionalities will be introduced. Actual case studies in databases to support OLTP EBS and OLAP OBIEE applications in Walgreens will be presented with dramatic performance improvement on analytical SQLs.
