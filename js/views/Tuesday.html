				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">With the number of data breaches growing every day and the stringent regulatory landscape, safeguarding sensitive information has become critical. As part of Oracle’s defense-in-depth strategy, the Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT) helps identify areas of risk and recommends changes to mitigate configuration, operational, and technical risks. Attend this hands-on lab and learn how to easily run DBSAT to identify your exposure to the top database security risks and how to remediate them. Learn how to analyze and prioritize the different risk findings identified within the security reports so that you are well on the way to securing your databases.<br><br><a href="0" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">The schemaless nature of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has enabled it to become an extremely popular method for persisting application data. Oracle Database 12c provides end-to-end support for JSON data: the database can store, index, and query JSON content in a highly performant manner. In addition to providing flexible SQL access to JSON data, Oracle Database also fully supports the schemaless development paradigm in which applications can be built using simple document-store APIs. This hands-on lab provides an introduction to the JSON-related features of Oracle Database 12c.<br><br><a href="0" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Traditional Business Intelligence dashboards and operational reports are falling short of answering tough questions that factory and supply chain managers are asking today. There is a need to look at the same data with a different lens since the answers to these questions rely on discovering relationships and correlations that exist within extremely large data sets. This is where new techniques related to Data Science and Data Mining can come to rescue. They help identify anomalies and outliers in the data as well as try to classify data into different categories based on common characteristics. Applying such techniques can help manufacturers quickly get to the root cause and patterns of interest that relate to poor yield and quality. <br><br><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6351" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining a lot of ground. Successful implementations have ranged from simple remote monitoring and asset tracking to more advanced predictive maintenance and service. In this session, we will discuss two key trends. The first is Digital Twin – a software representation model of a physical asset. It can model the physical world, predict the future, interact with the simulated versions of the devices and ask what-if questions. The second is Digital Thread – a contextual sequence of actions that connects a digital supply chain from product design to fulfillment to manufacturing to warehousing to transportation and logistics and service. We will discuss these trends and their benefits for applied IoT deployments.<br><br><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6904" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Many development teams are actively looking for new agile and efficient ways to expand the breadth, depth and sophistication of their data analysis. This presentation will explore how to develop an agile self-describing (i.e polymorphic) analytical framework that can support the new types of fast-moving data discovery and big data analytics that are a key part of modern data warehousing. We will explore how developers can create agile, efficient, scalable, self-describing user-defined analytic functions that can greatly simplify data discovery and analysis of big data for report writers, application developers, data analysts and data scientists. <br><br><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6642" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Back again by popular demand, and updated with your latest real-world issues. Be a hero with your DBA! Learn how to identify database key performance indicators, classify relevant workloads, and analyze AWR/STATSPACK reports to make meaningful recommendations for what is needed in your database system infrastructure to meet your performance service-level objectives. The methods discussed will apply equally to on-premises and cloud based infrastructure. This session focuses principally on transactional and analytics workloads, with some discussion of data warehouse workloads. Attendees have been turned away from this session in previous years, so register early. <br><br><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON4350" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Most SQL is so simple to write that we can hand off the job to an ORM tool or similar mechanism. But by delving a little deeper into more advanced SQL techniques, we can get performance benefits and write a lot less middle-tier code. This session highlights some SQL techniques to solve problems that would otherwise require a lot of complex coding. Learn how to become a more productive developer by expanding your knowledge of the SQL language. <br><br><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=CON6735" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Millions of dollars are spent every year on big data analysis of tweets, trends, Facebook commentary and social media sentiment. Detecting money laundering, fraud and other financial crimes becomes more difficult as the structure of shell corporations and the flow of transactions follow labyrinthine structures. Identifying suspicious activities, false information and fraudulent patterns is increasingly important in today’s information economy. See how graph analysis, database and visualization tools expose fabricated trends, troll and bot-created content and fraudulent financial transactions.

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">Organizations are capturing data in a variety of data stores including Oracle Database, NoSQL, and Hadoop. Oracle Big Data SQL allows you to use Oracle SQL and security policies to seamlessly query across these stores. This means that existing Oracle Database query applications—without changes—will now be able to take advantage of this new information. This hands-on lab introduces you to how this is achieved: providing access to big data sources, implementing unified security, and delivering analyses that combine and correlate all data.<br><br><a href="0" target="_blank">Click here to view in catalog</a><br>
