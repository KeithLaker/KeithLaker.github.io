				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Databases are going to the cloud sooner or later. What does this mean for DBAs? Accenture conducted a battery of tests looking at Oracle Databases in the cloud. Nearly half the world’s data runs on Oracle Databases, making them a valuable focal point for such tests. The load on those vital databases continues to grow: with 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being generated every day, the performance and scalability of the database in the cloud is increasingly important. This session explores in detail the results of these texts, the importance of autonomous databases, Oracle Database 18c, and the new trends in Oracle Database technologies.	<br><br>

The main reason is Hadoop's notorious complexity, forcing users to spend most of their time keeping their clusters working and not enough time driving real innovation. Serverless changes the game by taking all the burden of installation, maintenance, and upgrade off of your hands while maintaining the flexibility and security that big data applications need. Oracle's serverless Spark service lets you run any Apache Spark application at any scale within seconds, with no cluster to maintain. In this session learn how to run any Spark job, including SQL, Python, R, or streaming; and keep your data safe with Oracle Identity Cloud Service integration.	<br><br>
