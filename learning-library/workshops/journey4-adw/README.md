# Getting Started with Autonomous Data Warehouse
This workshop walks you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse  (ADW)**. You will provision a new ADW database, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADW instance, scale an ADW instance, and use Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.


## Goals for this workshop

 - Get comfortable with Oracle's public cloud services
 - Provision a new ADW database
 - Run sample queries against the sample data sets
 - Load data from the object store
 - Query external data from the object store
 - Manage and Monitor an ADW instance
 - Scale an ADW instance
 - Use Oracle Machine Learning SQL notebooks
 - Use Oracle Data Visualization Desktop (DVD) with ADW
 - Use Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud (DIPC) with ADW
