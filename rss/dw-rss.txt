            <description><p>Many thanks to Prabhu&amp;nbsp;Thukkaram from the GoldenGate Streaming Analytics team for this post :).</p>

<p>GoldenGate Stream Analytics is a Spark-based platform for building stream processing applications. One of the key differentiators is productivity or time-to-value, which is a direct result of the following</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for diverse messaging platforms &amp;ndash; Kafka, OCI Streaming Service, JMS, Oracle AQ, MQTT, etc.</li>
	<li>Natively integrated with Oracle GoldenGate to process and analyze transaction streams from relational databases</li>
	<li>Interactive pipeline designer with live results to instantly validate your work</li>
	<li>Zero-code environment to build continuous ETL and analytics workflows</li>
	<li>Pattern library for advanced data transformation and real-time analytics</li>

	<li>Continuously refresh your DataMart, Datawarehouse, and Data Lake (ADW, OCI Object Store, HDFS/Hive, Oracle NoSQL, Mongo DB, AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Big Query, Redshift, etc.). Please note some of this will be arriving in 19.1.0.0.4 which is the next version.</li>
	<li>Alerts via Email, PagerDuty, Slack, etc., using OCI Notification Service</li>
</ul>

<p>This <a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-dwyZ9H3wE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>video</a> discusses industry use cases and demonstrates the ease with which data pipelines can be built and deployed using GoldenGate Stream Analytics. If you are aware of the value proposition and interested in deploying GGSA pipelines to Big Data service, then please continue reading.<br />
&amp;nbsp;<br />
The Marketplace instance of GoldenGate Stream Analytics embeds Apache Spark and Apache Kafka so data pipelines can be built and tested without other dependencies. While this is good for developers to quickly build and test pipelines, it is not ideal for enterprise deployments and production. For production we will need a runtime platform that can scale with increasing workloads, is highly available, and one that can be secured with highest standards. This blog describes how to run GGSA pipelines in the Big Data Service runtime environment.<br />
&amp;nbsp;</p>

Topology

<p>In this example, the marketplace instance of GoldenGate Stream Analytics is created in the same regional subnet as the BDS cluster. &amp;nbsp;A marketplace instance of Stream Analytics can be provisioned from <a href=&quot;https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/marketplace/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>here</a>. &amp;nbsp;You can also refer to the <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/osa/19.1/osamp/index.html&quot;>GGSA Marketplace user guide</a>. Big Data Service can be provisioned from <a href=&quot;https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/bigdata/clusters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>here</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Topology is shown in the diagram below and the GGSA instance is accessed using its public IP address.</p>

<p><br />
Please note your GoldenGate Stream Analytics instance will also act as a Bastion Host to your BDS cluster. Once you ssh to GGSA instance, you will also be able to ssh to all your BDS nodes. To do this you will need to copy your ssh private key to GGSA instance. You will also be able to access your Cloudera Manager using the same public IP of GGSA instance by following steps below.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;Topology where GGSA is a bastion connecting to cluster&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/e8f3928c-7512-4a66-82ed-f88dfefaf4c6/Image/da666d97bd93a7c82fb52cad3cb43e35/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_11_18_58_am.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 809px; height: 684px;&quot; /><br />
The default security list for the Regional Subnet must allow bidirectional traffic to edge/OSA node so create a stateful rule for destination port 443. Also create a similar Ingress rule for port 7183 to access the BDS Cloudera Manager via the OSA edge node. &amp;nbsp;An example Ingress rule is shown below.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;Example ingress rules&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/e8f3928c-7512-4a66-82ed-f88dfefaf4c6/Image/80e8f9f44e1a656a8e379def08fc1a2b/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_11_22_12_am.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 715px; height: 326px;&quot; /></p>

<p>SSH to GGSA box and run the following port forward commands so you can access the Cloudera Manager via the GGSA instance.</p>

<p><br />
sudo firewall-cmd --add-forward-port=port=7183:proto=tcp:toaddr=&amp;lt;IP address of Utility Node running the Cloudera Manager console&amp;gt;<br />
sudo firewall-cmd --runtime-to-permanent<br />
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1<br />
sudo &amp;nbsp;iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 7183 -j DNAT --to-destination &amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;IP address of Utility Node running the Cloudera Manager console&amp;gt;:7183<br />
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE</p>

<p>You should now be able to access the Cloudera Manager using the URL https://&amp;lt;Public IP of GGSA&amp;gt;:7183</p>

Prerequisites

<ol>
	<li>Retrieve IP addresses of BDS cluster nodes from OCI console as shown in screenshot below. Alternatively, you can get the FQDN for BDS nodes from the Cloudera Manager as shown in the next screenshot.</li>
</ol>

<ol start=&quot;2&quot;>
	<li>Patch spark-osa.jar in $OSA_HOME/osa-base/resources/modules/spark-osa.jar so dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname is set to true. Please make a copy of spark-osa.jar before replacing with the patch. This will be automatic in the next OS&amp;rsaquo;A version 19.1.0.0.4. None of this workaround will be necessary. &amp;nbsp;For now you can obtain the patch from here and here are the steps to patch
	<ul>
		<li>ssh to your OSA instance and run &amp;quot;wget https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/p/eSUyKwLXi1e3A5hEyx6anLqgjmDLU3twgtdnARMjrss/n/paasdevehcs/b/TEMP-GGSA/o/spark-osa.jar&amp;quot;</li>
		<li>Stop OSA by running &amp;ldquo;sudo systemctl stop osa&amp;rdquo;</li>
		<li>Copy /u01/app/osa/osa-base/resources/modules/spark-osa.jar ~/spark-osa.jar.backup</li>
		<li>Copy downloaded ~/spark-osa.jar to /u01/app/osa/osa-base/resources/modules/spark-osa.jar</li>
		<li>Start OSA by running &amp;ldquo;sudo systemctl start osa&amp;rdquo;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Reconfigure YARN virtual cores using Cloudera Manager as shown below. <strong>This will allow many pipelines to run in the cluster and not bound by actual physical cores.<br />
	<img alt=&quot;YARN configuration in Cloudera Manager&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/e8f3928c-7512-4a66-82ed-f88dfefaf4c6/Image/99cb59529aa20f2a1a5197eb3dbf7c31/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_11_35_33_am.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 709px; height: 376px;&quot; />Container Virtual CPU Cores :-</strong> This is the total virtual CPU cores available to YARN Node Manager for allocation to Containers. Please note this is not limited by physical cores and you can set this to a high number, say 32 even for VM standard 2.1.<br />
	<strong>Container Virtual CPU Cores Minimum :-</strong> This is the minimum vcores that will be allocated by YARN scheduler to a Container. Please set this to 2 since CQL engine is a long-running task and will require a dedicated vcore.<br />
	<strong>Container Virtual CPU Cores Maximum :-</strong> This is the maximum vcores that will be allocated by YARN scheduler to a Container. Please set this to a number higher than 2 say 4.<br />
	<strong>Note:</strong> this change will require a restart of the YARN cluster from Cloudera Manager.<br />
	&amp;nbsp;</li>
	<li>If using Kafka from OSA Marketplace instance, set advertised listeners to private IP of the OSA node and port 9092 in <strong>/u01/app/kafka/config/server.properties</strong>. E.g. advertised_listeners=PLAINTEXT://10.0.0.13:9092. Please restart the Kafka service after this change by running &amp;ldquo;sudo systemctl restart kafka&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;This will be automatic in the next OSA version 19.1.0.0.4.</li>
</ol>

Deploying GGSA Pipelines to Non-Kerberized Dev/Test BDS cluster

<p>In GGSA system settings dialog, configure the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set Kafka Zookeeper Connection to Private IP of the OSA node. E.g. 10.0.0.59:2181</li>
	<li>Set Runtime Server to Yarn</li>
	<li>Set Yarn Resource Manager URL to Private IP or Hostname of the BDS Master node (E.g. xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com)</li>
	<li>Set storage type to HDFS</li>
	<li>Set Path to &amp;lt;PrivateIP or Host Of Master&amp;gt;&amp;lt;HDFS Path&amp;gt;. E.g. 10.x.x.x/user/oracle/ggsapipelines or xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com/user/oracle/ggsapipelines.&amp;nbsp;</li>
	<li>Set HA Namenode to Private IP or Hostname of the BDS Master node. E.g. xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com</li>
	<li>Set Yarn Master Console port to 8088 or as configured in BDS</li>
	<li>Set Hadoop authentication to Simple and leave Hadoop protection policy at authentication if available</li>
	<li>Set username to &amp;quot;oracle&amp;quot; and click Save.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>A sample screenshot is shown below:<br />
<img alt=&quot;GGSA Settings&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/e8f3928c-7512-4a66-82ed-f88dfefaf4c6/Image/ff73ff1fe46a7fb6805ca7862a7d2a1a/settings_simple.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 690px; height: 528px;&quot; /><br />
Deploying GGSA Pipelines to Kerberized Production BDS Cluster</p>

<p>In GGSA system settings dialog, configure the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set Kafka Zookeeper Connection to Private IP of the OSA node. E.g. 10.0.0.59:2181</li>
	<li>Set Runtime Server to Yarn</li>
	<li>Set Yarn Resource Manager URL to Private IPs of all master nodes starting with the one running active Yarn Resource Manager. In the next version of OSA, the ordering will not be needed. E.g. xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com, xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com</li>
	<li>Set storage type to HDFS</li>
	<li>Set Path to &amp;lt;NameNode Nameservice&amp;gt;&amp;lt;HDFS Path&amp;gt;. E.g. bdsggsasec-ns/user/oracle/ggsapipelines. The path will automatically be created if it does not exist but the Hadoop User must have write permissions. NameNode&amp;nbsp;Nameservice can be obtained from HDFS configuration as shown in the screenshot below.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt=&quot;Namenode Name Service&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/e8f3928c-7512-4a66-82ed-f88dfefaf4c6/Image/57170f39c977c1babc91ff3a9823acf8/screen_shot_2020_08_11_at_11_44_16_am.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 713px; height: 380px;&quot; /></p>

<ol start=&quot;6&quot;>
	<li>Set HA Namenode to Private IPs or hostnames of all master nodes (comma separated) starting with the one running active NameNode server. In the next version of OSA, the ordering will not be needed. E.g. xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com, xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com</li>
	<li>Set Yarn Master Console port to 8088 or as configured in BDS</li>
	<li>Set Hadoop authentication to Kerberos</li>
	<li>Set Kerberos Realm to BDACLOUDSERVICE.ORACLE.COM</li>
	<li>Set Kerberos KDC to private IP or hostname of one of the BDS master nodes. E.g. xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com</li>
	<li>Set principal to bds@BDACLOUDSERVICE.ORACLE.COM. &amp;nbsp;Please see this documentation to create a Kerberos principal (e.g. bds) and add it to hadoop admin group, starting with step &amp;quot;Connect to Cluster&amp;#39;s First Master Node&amp;quot; and &amp;nbsp;through the step &amp;quot;Update HDFS Supergroup&amp;quot;. Note, you can hop/ssh to the master node using your GGSA node as the Bastion. You will need your ssh private key to be available on GGSA node though. Also, do not forget to restart your BDS cluster as instructed in the documentation.<br />
	<br />
	[opc@bdsggsa ~]$ ssh -i id_rsa_prabhu opc@xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com</li>
	<li>Make sure the newly created principal is added to Kerberos keytab file on the master node as shown&amp;nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	bdsmn0 # sudo<strong> kadmin.local</strong><br />
	kadmin.local:<strong> ktadd -k /etc/krb5.keytab bds@BDACLOUDSERVICE.ORACLE.COM</strong></li>
	<li>Fetch the keytab file using sftp, etc and set Keytab field in system settings by uploading the same</li>
	<li>Set Yarn Resource Manager principal which should be in the format &amp;ldquo;yarn/&amp;lt;FQDN of BDS MasterNode running Active Resource Manager&amp;gt;@KerberosRealm&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;E.g. yarn/xxxxx.devintnetwork.oraclevcn.com@BDACLOUDSERVICE.ORACLE.COM<br />

Running Samples on BDS

<p>To import a sample, click &amp;ldquo;import&amp;rdquo; on any of the six samples in screenshot below and switch to Catalog or just click on the circle. &amp;nbsp;To run the sample on BDS change the hostname in Kafka connection of the sample pipeline from &amp;ldquo;localhost&amp;rdquo; to the private IP address (run hostname -i to get IP address) of the GGSA instance node. After this change you can just open the pipeline or you can publish the pipeline and then open the associated dashboard. Please see screenshots below.</p>

            <title>How To Manually Upgrade Your Autonomous Database from 18c to 19c</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/how-to-manually-upgrade-your-autonomous-database-from-18c-to-19c</link>
            <description><p>In a recent newsletter (<a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/autonomous-database-newsletter-april-08-2020#db19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>April 08, 2020</a>)&amp;nbsp;I mentioned that<span>&amp;nbsp;</span>Oracle Database 19c is now available on Autonomous Database for all regions. The default version for all new databases is 19c and going forward, most new Autonomous Database features will only be available for databases using Oracle Database 19c. Around this time, you should have noticed some new messages appearing on your ADW console if your ADW instance was using Database version 18c. At the top of screen a new information banner appeared:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/d2354f5661d3072dfa0b78413b86f72a/screenshot_2020_08_05_at_13_00_22.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 568px; height: 67px;&quot; /></p>

<p>and next to the Database version information there was another information message:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/1c807a2b23efa4c9742769f51942961c/screenshot_2020_08_05_at_13_00_16.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 290px; height: 34px;&quot; /></p>

<p>This was to let everyone know that it&amp;#39;s possible to manually upgrade to Database 19c right now. Of course, we will be automatically upgrading instances during September and email notifications from the Cloud Ops team will be sent shortly that will outline the plans for upgrading instances.</p>

<p>But as my recent <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/autonomous-database-newsletter-july-22-2020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>newsletter</a>&amp;nbsp;pointed out - most new features are only available if you are using 19c. Therefore, to get the most from your Autonomous Database it really does make sense to manually upgrade to 19c now and not wait for the automatic upgrade in September. For example, if you are using the built-in APEX environment, then you definitely want to be using the latest version 20.1 which has a lot of great new features (see <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/autonomous-database-newsletter-july-15-2020#apex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>July 15 newsletter</a>)&amp;nbsp;BUT your ADB instance has to be 19c.</p>

<p>So, how do you manually upgrade your ADB instance from 18c to 19c?</p>

<p>Fortunately it only takes a few mouse clicks. Here is the general flow:</p>

<p>1) Goto your console page for your&amp;nbsp;ADW instance. You will see the upgrade announcement next to the database version information&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/b1a97e8ee8136ccd5d207ed3ee9968ee/slide3.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 601px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>and the banner at the top of the page:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/b43458eb43e34fb1a317700110c34c3b/slide4.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Click on either of the upgrade links to start the upgrade process:</p>

<p>3) This will pop a form over your console page. It&amp;#39;s similar to the other pop-up forms so to confirm you really do want to start the upgrade you need to enter the name of your ADB instance in the field shown below:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/cb8b7cafa264a7ed5be4a0ddda9d6836/slide7.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>4) Click the blue &amp;quot;Upgrade&amp;quot; button to start the upgrade process:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/e82e377b79cfbddb7948ba8dd47559ef/slide10.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>That&amp;#39;s it! Honestly, this is easiest upgrade you will ever do. It&amp;#39;s simpler than upgrading your iPhone!</p>

<p>Whilst the upgrade process is running your console page will look like this:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/e9c5601741b81dbb448f9a037c57b1f9/slide13.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>..and you will notice the status box is now orange and the status message says &amp;quot;UPGRADING&amp;quot;. There is an additional banner message that says &amp;quot;The database remains available during the upgrade&amp;quot;. No other database vendor is able to do this, everyone else forces their database to go offline during an upgrade which means all connections are terminated and all on-going workloads are lost.</p>

Can you track the upgrade process?

<p>Yes. The Work Request tab provides real-time status information for&amp;nbsp;the upgrade process</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/c3069a5f7aa45fe558f2585113a5d75e/slide17.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 601px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

What happens when the upgrade process is complete?

<p>As soon as the upgrade process has finished the Work Request screen will show the big green SUCCEEDED message:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/5bafabfdb10851041d31f005b67f86bb/slide20.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>That&amp;#39;s it, it&amp;#39;s all done and you are now running Database 19c. If you check the console page again you will notice that the banner message has now gone and the Database Version now says 19c.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/4ad7ae99543d28fa356635457f57cc95/slide24.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;width: 601px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

Conclusion

<p>Now you should be in a position to manually upgrade your own 18c ADB instances to 19c. Then you will be able to take advantage of all the new features we have recently rolled out such as the high availability feature, <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/autonomous-database-newsletter-july-22-2020#gwno&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Autonomous Data Guard</a>.&amp;nbsp;The whole end-to-end migration process is shown here:</p>

            <title>How to Access Non-Oracle Databases from Autonomous Database using Oracle Database Gateway</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/how-to-access-non-oracle-databases-from-autonomous-database-using-oracle-database-gateway</link>
            <description><p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Being able to create database links from Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S) to other ADB-S instances or Oracle databases has been one of the most sought-after features that we introduced. ADB-S now supports creating database links to Oracle Database Gateways in order to access non-Oracle databases. In this blog post, we are going to explore how to access a Microsoft SQL Server database from an ADB-S instance using a database link that we will create to a gateway.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Before we jump on the detailed steps, let&amp;rsquo;s do a quick recap of database links in ADB-S. As you may already know, ADB-S requires the target database to be configured with TCP/IP with SSL (TCPS) authentication for outgoing database links since it uses TCPS authentication by default. What this means is that the gateway we want to connect needs to be configured with TCPS authentication as well. We already covered how to configure an Oracle database, such as DBCS, with TCPS authentication in <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/how-to-create-a-database-link-from-an-autonomous-data-warehouse-to-a-database-cloud-service-instance-v2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>one of my earlier blog posts</a>. Good news is that configuring Oracle Database Gateway with TCPS is very similar and requires couple minor additional steps. Let&amp;rsquo;s start!</span></span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>The non-Oracle database that I will be using for this demonstration is Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Express running on Windows Server 2019. For simplicity, I chose to install Oracle Database Gateway 19c on the same Windows VM. The installation of the gateway using the Oracle Universal Installer is extremely quick and simple. All you need to provide is a Windows user that has no admin privileges (gateway owner), which non-Oracle database you are planning to connect to and the details of that database such as host name, port number, database name etc. The installer also partially configures a listener for the gateway during the installation and it&amp;rsquo;s possible to choose TCPS authentication in the UI&amp;nbsp;(I will explain what I mean by &amp;#39;partially&amp;#39; in a moment). Here&amp;rsquo;s how my <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>listener.ora</span> looked like after the installation (note the TCPS protocol in the listener description):</span></span></p>


 
# listener.ora Network Configuration File: C:\app\GW\product\19.0.0\tghome_1\NETWORK\ADMIN\listener.ora
# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCPS)(HOST = ctuzlaWindows)(PORT = 1522))
    )
  )

  (SID_LIST= 
    (SID_DESC=

      (ORACLE_HOME=C:\app\GW\product\19.0.0\tghome_1)
      (PROGRAM=dg4msql)
    ) 
  )


<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>In the <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>listener.ora</span> above, <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>LISTENER</span> was automatically created by the installer; however, I had to manually add the <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>SID_LIST_LISTENER</span> variable. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>SID_NAME</span> is the SID of the gateway and <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>GLOBAL_DBNAME</span> is the service name of the gateway. The value of the <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>GLOBAL_DBNAME</span> variable can be anything you specify and this is the value that we will be using as the target database service name when we create our database link from our Autonomous Database. Additionally, as you can tell from the <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>ORACLE_HOME</span> path, GW is our Windows user who is also the gateway owner.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Even though our listener already has the TCPS endpoint, we still need to perform couple additional steps so that our ADB-S instance can successfully communicate with the gateway. Here are the steps needed to complete the TCPS configuration in our gateway:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Create wallets with self signed certificates for server and client</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Exchange certificates between server and client wallets (Export/import certificates)</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Add wallet location in the server network files</span></span></li>
</ul>

<strong><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Create wallets with self signed certificates for server and client</span></span></strong>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>As part of enabling TCPS authentication, we need to create individual wallets for the server and the client. Each of these wallets has to have their own certificates that they will exchange with one another. For the sake of this example, I will be using a self signed certificate. The client wallet and certificate can be created in the client side; however, I&amp;#39;ll be creating my client wallet and certificate in the server and moving them to Object Store later on. See <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/dbseg/configuring-secure-sockets-layer-authentication.html#GUID-6AD89576-526F-4D6B-A539-ADF4B840819F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Configuring Secure Sockets Layer Authentication</a>&amp;nbsp;for more information. </span></span></p>

<p>This&amp;nbsp;is all you need in order to access a non-Oracle database from your Autonomous Database! In this post, we have gone through gateway installation, TCPS configuration in gateways, target environment tips and database link creation in order to access a SQL Server database. The same steps apply to other non-Oracle databases that are supported by Oracle Database Gateway as well.</p>

            <title>Using OCI Resource Manage to deploy a complete end-to-end data warehouse</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/using-oci-resource-manage-to-deploy-a-complete-end-to-end-data-warehouse</link>
            <description>A while back, I announced in the <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/newsletter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Autonomous Database Newsletter</a> (<a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/autonomous-database-newsletter-june-24-2020#rap&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>June 24 edition</a>) that we now had a series of reference architecture patterns for Autonomous Data Warehouse. Currently, the following patterns are available (<em>note: more patterns are being built and will be added shortly</em>):
<ul>
	<li><a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-ebs-analysis/index.html&quot; name=&quot;cta=External Link Click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Departmental data warehousing - an EBS integration example</a></li>
	<li><a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-spreadsheet-analysis/index.html&quot; name=&quot;cta=External Link Click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Departmental data warehousing/data marts - consolidate spreadsheets</a></li>
	<li><a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/oci-curated-analysis/index.html&quot; name=&quot;cta=External Link Click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Enterprise data warehousing - an integrated data lake example</a></li>
	<li><a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/data-science-environment/index.html#GUID-CE4B3020-881C-481D-B434-199388C3ADD3&quot; name=&quot;cta=External Link Click&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Set up a data science environment that uses Oracle Machine Learning</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each reference architecture pattern comes&amp;nbsp;with the following: best practices framework; a set of recommendations which are a starting point for implementing the pattern and a terraform script for deploying the end-to-end set of cloud services on OCI. That was great news for everyone because you now had a very precise system architecture&amp;nbsp;plan for each data warehouse use case that could be expanded to incorporate additional use cases as your data warehouse project evolved over time.</p>

<p>These patterns were the result of a some amazing work by our Enterprise Architecture, OCI andADB PM teams. There are a lot more patterns to come and I will let you know as new ones get added to the list.</p>

<p>I have used a couple of the patterns myself and, if I am honest, while the Terraform scripts are great it was hard work to setup all the required keys etc and get everything in to place so I could run one of the pre-built Terraform scripts. But then again, Terraform is a completely new area for me!</p>

<p>Then this week our OCI team announced they have&amp;nbsp;added one of our data warehouse patterns to the list of pre-built stacks within <a href=&quot;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>OCI Resource Manager</a>. Here&amp;#39;s a screen grab of the list of built-in stacks that are ready for deploying:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/b98a78434d7507df090d0fbfc44302cd/screenshot_2020_07_23_at_12_46_38.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 247px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Right now, we have the &amp;quot;Departmental Data Warehouse&amp;quot; pattern available as a stack and this deploys an instance of Autonomous Database and an instance on Oracle Analytics Cloud for you. So how do you get started? Here is a walk-through of the main screens:</p>

<p>Step 1) - I have logged into my Always Free cloud account and arrived at the main OCI home page:</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/68f29f2ced7bc0d11f6ad7e5471bf249/slide1.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 2 - I have opened the main menu tree and scrolled down to <strong>Resource Manager</strong> and then selected &amp;quot;<strong>Stacks</strong>&amp;quot;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/41f4e9da371740898a33d223843c8f30/slide5.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 3 - As this is the first stack I have built my home page is currently empty. Obviously we click on the blue <strong>Create Stack</strong> button.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/7477f491200093737cd643432c6eb7d4/slide7.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 4 - I can build my own stack deployment process or I can select to use a pre-built stack and this is what we need to use in this case...</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/71b9a2c6d2de83d89a335ed3fa966bf0/slide9.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 5 - this pops a form which lists all the available pre-built stacks as I showed above. In this case I want to build a departmental data warehouse so let&amp;#39;s select that box</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/831bf7ad0111e7b6db0784ab4ad2a6c9/slide11.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 6 - now I can set the name and description for my deployment &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; along with the compartment I want to use in my deployment (if you are not sure what a compartment is or does then spend a few minutes looking at <a href=&quot;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>this page</a> in the documentation). Once you are happy with the information on this page, click the <strong>Next</strong> button in the bottom left corner.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/d42fe51cfd735ef5080fc8fec0e0fefd/slide14.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 7 - this brings us to the form which is going to capture the information about our ADW and OAC instances. In the screen below you can see that I have set the number of CPUs for my ADW instance as 1, I have set the password for my ADMIN user, I have changed the name and display name for my new database, I have elected to build a 19c autonomous data warehouse and I have enabled auto-scaling. For storage, I am going to start with 1 TB. Just point out....both the number of OCPUs and the amount of storage and can be scaled independently and with zero downtime.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/2a83aa6199c907a77330ff5d4c47c025/slide20.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>Step 8 - scrolling down....I can set my license type. We allow you to bring your on-premise licenses to the cloud or you can simply buy additional licenses as required. With this departmental warehouse project I know I am going to include personally identifiable information about some of our&amp;nbsp;employees so I need to keep that data totally safe and secure. Therefore, I am going to register my ADW instance with our <a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/data-safe.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Data Safe</a> service (which is free to use with Autonomous Database).</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/275caec9b7044069460b2342b4534589/slide26.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>...and to further protect my ADW instance this pre-built stack automatically uses Access Control Lists (ACLs). If you want more information about to use ACLs then <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/security-restrict-acl.html#GUID-90E6CF76-E6C4-4B7E-B424-91DBB35DFE0F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>click here</a>. This process within Resource Manager will automatically configure the ACLs so that OAC can connect to my ADW instance so that&amp;#39;s all taken care of but I need to allow my desktop computer to access my ADW instance as well. Therefore, I have to enter the public IP address for my desktop computer. If you don&amp;#39;t include this information then you will not be able to use any of the desktop tools or built-in tools that come with ADW.</p>

<p>Step 9 - &amp;nbsp;Setup the details for my OAC instance. Again, I have opted for 1 OCPU and I am going to take&amp;nbsp;the ENTERPRISE_ANALYTICS deployment option since this gives me access to all the features I need. If you use the pulldown menu you will there are two options: 1)Self-service analytics deploys an instance with data visualization,&amp;nbsp;and 2)&amp;nbsp;Enterprise analytics deploys an instance with enterprise modeling, reporting, and data visualization.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/96b3e8236835bc559cab53f2b4ed82e8/slide28.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 10 - and now we are at the end of the process and ready to deploy our end-to-end departmental data warehouse. The review page gives us a chance to make sure everything is correct before we hit the <strong>Create</strong>&amp;nbsp;button.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/3f1f9085-e459-4b23-85f7-ed09e21ffb29/Image/43bd65d130076ced63f40237b99a1cd3/slide30.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 338px;&quot; /></p>

<p>The <strong>Jobs</strong>&amp;nbsp;tab allows you to monitor progress of your deployment and at the end of this process you should have a new ADW instance and a new OAC instance within your tenancy. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<strong>Congratulations</strong>

<p>You should now have your new departmental data warehouse ready for use,</p>

<strong>What&amp;#39;s Next</strong>

<p>Next you can start loading data into your ADW instance. Take a look at the Chapter&amp;nbsp;3 in the ADW documentation which covers loading data with Autonomous Data Warehouse -&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/load-data.html#GUID-1351807C-E3F7-4C6D-AF83-2AEEADE2F83E&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/load-data.html#GUID-1351807C-E3F7-4C6D-AF83-2AEEADE2F83E</a></p>

<p>Then you can launch the Oracle Analytics home page in your browser, connect to your ADW instance and start building reports and dashboards.&amp;nbsp;The OAC product management team has put together a great series of labs that will get you started with OAC and ADW, see here:&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/uk/business-analytics/data-visualization/tutorials.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>https://www.oracle.com/uk/business-analytics/data-visualization/tutorials.html</a></p>

<p>Hope this was useful and I will let you know as we add more patterns to the solution library and more patterns into the pre-built stacks within OCI Resource Manager.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:55px;&quot;>If your primary database goes down, Autonomous Data Guard converts the standby database to the primary database with minimal interruption. After failover completes, Autonomous Data Guard automatically creates a new standby database.</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:55px;&quot;>You can perform a switchover operation, where the primary database becomes the standby database, and the standby database becomes the primary database.</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot;><strong>Note:</strong> Autonomous Database does not provide access to the standby database.</p>

            <title>Announcing Autonomous Data Guard!</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/announcing-autonomous-data-guard</link>
            <description><p>Just over a week ago, you may have heard Larry mention&amp;nbsp;Autonomous Data Guard at the live-streamed <a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/corporate/events/live/new-autonomous-services/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Oracle Live</a> event. Today, I am happy to announce this much-awaited disaster recovery (DR) feature in&amp;nbsp;Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S).</p>

<p>Autonomous Data Guard (ADG) gives users the ability to enable a standby database for each ADB instance&amp;nbsp;in a just one-click; As always in the Autonomous world -&amp;nbsp;It is completely&amp;nbsp;automated! Note that this is an advanced&amp;nbsp;feature available only in&amp;nbsp;19c and above ADB instances&amp;nbsp;and not available in the <a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Always-Free tier</a>. If you are still running database version 18c, consider <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-upgrade.html#GUID-47F4EA0B-C4B6-4135-A284-AE730D550F1C&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>upgrading to 19c in one-click</a> as well.</p>

<p>While ADB already runs on highly available Exadata infrastructure, this&amp;nbsp;feature further&amp;nbsp;protects your business&amp;#39;&amp;nbsp;data&amp;nbsp;against unforeseen disaster scenarios (think earthquakes, fires, floods,&amp;nbsp;major network outages etc.)&amp;nbsp; by automatically failing over to a standby database when the primary database goes down. Currently, ADB-S supports ADG within the same region (physically separated across Availability Domains)&amp;nbsp;and aims to support ADG across regions&amp;nbsp;later this year.</p>

<p>Before we jump right into using&amp;nbsp;this feature, let&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;brush up on some (simplified) <strong>disaster recovery terminology</strong> as it relates&amp;nbsp;to ADG:</p>

<p><strong>Peer Databases:</strong> Two or more databases that are peered (linked and replicated) between each other. They consist of a <u>Primary</u> database and&amp;nbsp;<u>Standby</u>&amp;nbsp;(copy of the primary) databases.</p>

<p><strong>Primary or Source&amp;nbsp;Database:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The main database that is actively being used to read from and write to by a user or application.</p>

<p><strong>Standby Database: </strong>A replica of the primary database&amp;nbsp;which is constantly and&amp;nbsp;passively refreshing (ie. replicating)&amp;nbsp;data from the primary. This standby database is used&amp;nbsp;in case of failure of the primary. In the case of ADG, we keep this standby on a different physical Exadata machine (in a different Availability Domain&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>in regions that have more than one</a>) for&amp;nbsp;the highest level of&amp;nbsp;protection.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recovery Point Objective (RPO):</strong> An organization&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;tolerance for&amp;nbsp;data loss, after which business operations start to get severely impacted,&amp;nbsp;usually expressed&amp;nbsp;in minutes. We want this to be as low as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery Time Object (RTO): </strong>An organization&amp;#39;s tolerance for the unavailability (or downtime) of a service after which&amp;nbsp;business operations start to get severely&amp;nbsp;impacted, usually expressed in minutes.&amp;nbsp;We want this to be as low as possible.</p>


<p>Armed with the above knowledge, let&amp;#39;s dive right into using Autonomous Data Guard. You already know how to navigate to your Autonomous Database console in OCI, by clicking on your database name in your list of database instances. As before, you should be using a 19c&amp;nbsp;version database.</p>

<p>Like magic, you now see <u>Autonomous Data Guard</u> as an option on your console. Click the &amp;quot;Enable&amp;quot; button on your console, followed by clicking the &amp;quot;Enable Autonomous Data Guard&amp;quot; confirmation button. (Okay, I lied...&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s 2 clicks, not 1).</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/fb69dd23454d69ad159b9b3a4485934c/enable.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 2500px; height: 845px;&quot; /></p>

<p>You&amp;#39;re done, that&amp;#39;s all you need to do to protect your database! You will now see your peered standby database in a Provisioning state until it becomes Available; depending on the size of your primary database this may take several&amp;nbsp;minutes.&amp;nbsp;Note that when you switch your&amp;nbsp;standby to make it your primary&amp;nbsp;as described below, <strong>you will not need a new wallet</strong> - Your existing wallet will continue to work seamlessly!</p>

<p>Everything that follows describes&amp;nbsp;features&amp;nbsp;you will use either in a&amp;nbsp;disaster type scenario, or to test your applications /&amp;nbsp;mid-tiers&amp;nbsp;against your Autonomous Database with ADG,</p>

&amp;nbsp;

Failover - When your Primary database goes down, you are automatically protected by your Standby database

<p>If a disaster were to occur and your primary database is brought down,&amp;nbsp;you can &amp;quot;<strong>Failover&amp;quot; </strong>to your standby.&amp;nbsp;A failover is a&amp;nbsp;role change, switching from the primary database&amp;nbsp;to the standby database when the primary is&amp;nbsp;down and&amp;nbsp;Unavailable, while the standby is Available.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>An&amp;nbsp;<u>Automatic Failover</u>&amp;nbsp;is automatically triggered (no user action needed) by the Autonomous Database when a user is unable to connect to their primary database for a few minutes. Since this is an automated action, we err on the side of caution and allow auto-failovers to succeed only when we can guarantee&amp;nbsp;<u>no data loss</u> will occur.&amp;nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	For automatic failover,&amp;nbsp;RTO is 2 minutes and RPO is 0 minutes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In the rare case when your primary is down and&amp;nbsp;Automatic Failover was unsuccessful, the&amp;nbsp;<u>Manual Failover</u>&amp;nbsp;button may&amp;nbsp;be triggered by&amp;nbsp;you, the user. During a manual failover, the system automatically recovers as much as data as possible&amp;nbsp;minimizing any potential data loss; there&amp;nbsp;<em>may</em>&amp;nbsp;be a few seconds or minutes of data loss. You&amp;nbsp;would usually only perform a Manual Failover in a true disaster scenario,&amp;nbsp;accepting the&amp;nbsp;few minutes of potential data loss to ensure getting your database back online as soon as possible.<br />
	<br />
	For manual failover,&amp;nbsp;<span>t</span>he RTO is 2 minutes and RPO is 5&amp;nbsp;minutes.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>After a failover, a new&amp;nbsp;standby for your primary will&amp;nbsp;automatically be provisioned.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/95d44c6fbaae9b5f78ecd1e12ded3d36/adb_failover_manual1.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 1365px; height: 306px;&quot; /></p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

&amp;nbsp;

Switchover - Test your applications with Autonomous Data Guard when both databases are healthy

<p>When your standby is provisioned, you will&amp;nbsp;see a &amp;quot;<strong>Switchover</strong>&amp;quot; option&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;the console&amp;nbsp;while your primary and standby databases are both healthy (ie. in the&amp;nbsp;Available or Stopped states). Clicking the Switchover button performs&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;role change switching from the primary database&amp;nbsp;to the standby database,&amp;nbsp;which may take&amp;nbsp;a couple of minutes,&amp;nbsp;with <u>no data loss guaranteed</u>.</p>

<p>You would usually perform a Switchover to test your applications&amp;nbsp;against this&amp;nbsp;role change behaviour of the primary.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/b2cecd9ea156e734072f71c17b445855/screen_shot_2020_07_10_at_5_06_08_pm.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 1573px; height: 731px;&quot; /></p>

<p>We talked above about the buttons on the UI console. Of course, as with the rest of Oracle&amp;#39;s cloud platform,&amp;nbsp;there are <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-data-guard-api.html#GUID-3E4C0FA6-DE04-4F7F-A7AF-4C270870DCFF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Autonomous Database APIs</a> for all actions including Switchover and Failover that can be called at any time. You may also subscribe to <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-data-guard-events.html#GUID-1C9BF3E2-BCC9-4268-B4AF-2A04AEBE46E1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Events</a> to be notified of your standby&amp;#39;s operations.</p>

&amp;nbsp;

Wrapping Up

<p>While we ideated over Autonomous Data Guard, our primary focus has been that it should just work,&amp;nbsp;with nothing for a user to do.&amp;nbsp;My hope is that every user with a production database out there takes advantage of this&amp;nbsp;simplicity&amp;nbsp;and is able to further minimize&amp;nbsp;their business&amp;#39; operational downtime and data loss. For all the details&amp;nbsp;about Autonomous Data Guard features please refer to the <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-data-guard-about.html#GUID-AF736587-4F6D-45C3-9886-7211B0A33745&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>official documentation</a>&amp;nbsp;and for updated pricing refer to the <a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/contracts/paas-iaas-universal-credits-3940775.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>service description</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for Part 2 of this post later this year, once we are ready to announce&amp;nbsp;Autonomous Data Guard across regions!</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot;>Autonomous Database now supports using connections that are enabled via Oracle Database Gateway. Gateways are designed for accessing a specific non-Oracle Database such as DB2, Teradata, SQL Server etc.</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot;>Oracle Database Gateway provide queries and applications with access to data anywhere in a distributed database system without knowing either the location of the data or how it is stored. This removes the need to customize applications to access data from non-Oracle systems.</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot;>An Autonomous Database instance will automatically pick up updated time zone files depending on the lifecycle state of the instance:</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:45px;&quot;>- Stopped: At the next start operation the update is automatically applied.<br />
						- Available: After a restart the update is automatically applied.</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot;>When a load or import operation results in a timezone related error, restart the ADB instance and try again.</p>

						<span style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot;>NEW </span><span class=&quot;feature_header&quot;> - ADB now supports ORC files</span>
						<p>ADB has expanded object storage support in two important ways: it can now query <a href=&quot;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+ORC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>ORC files</a> as well as complex data types found in Parquet, ORC and Avro files.</p>

						<p style=&quot;margin-left:25px; font-style:italic;&quot;>The Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) file is a highly efficient way to store Hive data. It was designed to overcome limitations of the other Hive file formats. Like Parquet, ORC data is stored in a compressed columnar format and provides metadata to enable efficient reads.</p>

						<p>ORC, Parquet and Avro file types provide the ability to capture fields containing complex data types, including arrays, maps, unions and objects (or structs). These complex types can now be queried in ADB using Oracle&amp;rsquo;s extensive JSON query support.</p>

						<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: support for ORC and complex data types are only available in 19c.</em></p>

            <title>Query ORC files and complex data types in Object Storage with Autonomous Database</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/query-orc-files-and-complex-data-types-in-object-storage-with-autonomous-database</link>
            <description><p>Apache ORC is a columnar file type that is common to the Hadoop ecosystem. &amp;nbsp;It is similar in concept to Apache Parquet; Hortonworks Hadoop clusters often leveraged ORC &amp;ndash; while Cloudera clusters utilized Parquet. &amp;nbsp;Like parquet, ORC is a database file designed for efficient reads. Files embed a schema, data is stored in a compressed columnar format, predicate pushdown enables data pruning &amp;ndash; sound familiar? &amp;nbsp;See the <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/oracle-autonomous-data-warehouse-access-parquet-files-in-object-stores&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Parquet blog post</a> if you want a refresher :)</p>

<p>In addition, ORC provides the ability to capture&amp;nbsp;complex data types &amp;ndash; including arrays, maps, unions and objects (or structs). &amp;nbsp;This capability too is similar to both Parquet and Avro.</p>

<p>Autonomous Database now supports querying object store data that is captured in ORC format &amp;ndash; in addition to text, Avro and Parquet. &amp;nbsp;And, across the structured file types &amp;ndash; you can now also query complex data types. &amp;nbsp;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;ll extend the movie file that was used in our previous Avro post (we downloaded this data from Wikipedia) - this time using the ORC file type with an extra column. The movie file has the following schema:</p>

<p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;>id int<br />
original_title string<br />
overview string<br />
poster_path string<br />
release_date string<br />
vote_count int<br />
runtime int<br />
popularity double<br />
<strong>genres array&amp;lt;struct&amp;lt;id:int,name:string&amp;gt;</strong></p>

<p>Notice that each movie is categorized by multiple genres (an array of genres). &amp;nbsp;This array is an array of objects - or structs: &amp;nbsp;each genre has an id (integer) and a name (string).&amp;nbsp; Let&amp;#39;s take a look at how to access this data in Autonomous Database.&amp;nbsp; After creating a credential object that enables access to Oracle Object Storage, create a table using dbms_cloud.create_external table:</p>

<p>begin<br />
&amp;nbsp; DBMS_CLOUD.create_credential (<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; credential_name =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;OBJ_STORE_CRED&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; username =&amp;gt; abc@oracle.com&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; password =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;12345&amp;#39;<br />
&amp;nbsp; ) ;<br />
<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; dbms_cloud.create_external_table (<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; table_name =&amp;gt;&amp;#39;movie_info&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; credential_name =&amp;gt;&amp;#39;OBJ_STORE_CRED&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; file_uri_list =&amp;gt;&amp;#39;https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/abcd/b/movies/o/movie-info.orc&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; format =&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;#39;{&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;orc&amp;quot;, &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;schema&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;first&amp;quot;}&amp;#39;<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; );<br />
end;<br />
/</p>

<p>Notice you don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify the shape of the data. &amp;nbsp;The columns and data types are automatically derived by reading the metadata contained in the ORC file. &amp;nbsp;This created a table with the following DDL:&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE &amp;quot;ADMIN&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;MOVIE_INFO&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;ID&amp;quot; NUMBER(10,0),&amp;nbsp;<br />

<p>So, how will you handle the complex data? &amp;nbsp;Simple&amp;hellip; data will be returned as JSON. &amp;nbsp;Thus, despite the fact that different file types store the same data in different ways, your query&amp;nbsp;can be totally agnostic of this fact.&amp;nbsp; You see the same JSON output for all common complex types. &amp;nbsp;Use Oracle&amp;#39;s rich JSON query processing capabilities against the table.</p>

<p>Running a simple query against this table yields the following:</p>

<p style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;>select original_title, release_date, genres<br />
from movie_info<br />
where release_date &amp;gt; &amp;#39;2000&amp;#39;<br />
order by original_title;</p>

<p>Notice that the genres returned as a json array.&amp;nbsp; Let&amp;#39;s make that JSON data more useful.&amp;nbsp; The JSON can be transformed using Oracle&amp;#39;s JSON functions - including the simple &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; notation as well as the more powerful transform functions like JSON_TABLE. &amp;nbsp;The example below queries the table - turning each value of the array into a row in the result set:</p>

<p>JSON_TABLE was used in this case to 1) create a row for each value of the array (think outer join) and 2) the struct was parsed to extract the name of the genre.</p>

<p>Autonomous Database continues to expand its ability to effectively query external source. &amp;nbsp;Look for more to come in this area soon!</p>

            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/oracle-database-vault-on-autonomous-database%3A-quickly-and-easily</link>
            <description><p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>We often talk about how to protect our data from external threats by implementing various practices such as encrypting our data, only allowing connections via TCPS authentication or even further, deploying our databases in a private network. However, these security practices might not be sufficient to eliminate the threats that can originate from unauthorized privileged user access or unauthorized database changes. Good news is that Oracle Database Vault offers comprehensive access control capabilities to prevent those internal threats. What&amp;rsquo;s better is that you can use it in your Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-S) as well! </span></span></p>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>In this blog post, we are going to focus on how to take advantage of Database Vault in ADB-S by just following a few simple steps:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Enable Database Vault </span></span></li>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Control Privileged User Access</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Create a Realm to Protect Your Data</span></span></li>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Disable Database Vault</span></span></li>
</ol>

<strong><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Enable Database Vault </span></span></strong>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>To configure and enable Oracle Database Vault on Autonomous Database, we will follow the steps described in our <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/autonomous-database-vault.html#GUID-70F233AF-458F-44B7-9418-F9AF70CFDD15&quot;>documentation</a>:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Create two users, one to be the Database Vault owner while the other one to be the Database Vault account manager. This is the first step towards implementing separation of duties.</span></span></li>

<strong><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>Control Privileged User Access</span></span></strong>

<p><span style=&quot;font-size:12pt&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family:Calibri,sans-serif&quot;>In the previous section, we have seen how to set up separate users to be the designated Database Vault owner and account manager. This was an important step in order to achieve separation of duties; however, we are not done yet. In Autonomous Database, <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>ADMIN</span> user has <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>DV_OWNER</span> and <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>DV_ACCTMGR</span> roles by default. What this means is that even after configuring and enabling Database Vault with different users, <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>ADMIN</span> user can still perform certain operations such user management thanks to these roles. Even though <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>ADMIN</span> can be considered as a backup account for both Database Vault owner and account manager, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to revoke these roles from <span style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New'&quot;>ADMIN</span> as we will see below.</span></span></p>

						<p>The Database Service Metrics information help Cloud Admins measure useful quantitative data about their Autonomous Databases. This list of available metrics now includes two new latency metrics:</p>

						<div style=&quot;margin-left:25px&quot;>
						<p>1) Connection latency - Time taken (in milliseconds) to connect to an Autonomous Database that uses shared Exadata infrastructure in each region from a Compute service virtual machine in the same region.</p>

						<p>2) Query latency/response time - Time taken (in milliseconds) to display the results of a simple query on the user&amp;#39;s screen.</p>
						</div>

						<p><em>Note - the tests to measure connection latency and query latency are not run against any customer instances.</em></p>

						<p>Within the Service Metrics console, it is possible to define and publish alarms against these new metrics.</p>

						<span style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot;>NEW </span><span class=&quot;feature_header&quot;> - SQL access to tenancy details for ADB</span>
						<p>When you file a service request for Autonomous Database, you need to provide the tenancy details for your instance. Tenancy details for the instance are available on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. However, if you are connected to the database, you can now obtain these details by querying the <strong>CLOUD_IDENTITY</strong> column of the <strong>V$PDBS view</strong>. For example:</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;font-family:courier !important; margin-left:40px;&quot;>SELECT cloud_identity<br />
						FROM v$pdbs;</p>

						<p>...will generate something similar to the following:</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;font-family:courier !important; margin-left:40px;&quot;>{&amp;quot;DATABASE_NAME&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;DBxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;quot;,<br />
						&amp;quot;REGION&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;us-phoenix-1&amp;quot;,<br />
						&amp;quot;TENANT_OCID&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;OCID1.TENANCY.REGION1..ID1&amp;quot;,<br />

            <title>Oracle Big Data SQL 4.1 is now available</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/oracle-big-data-sql-41-is-now-available</link>
            <description><p>I&amp;#39;m pleased to announce that Oracle Big Data SQL 4.1 is now available. &amp;nbsp;This is a significant release that enables you to take advantage of new Oracle Database 19c capabilities plus core Big Data SQL enhancements.</p>

<p>Big Data SQL enables organizations to easily&amp;nbsp;analyze data across Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, NoSQL, object stores and&amp;nbsp;Oracle Database leveraging their existing Oracle SQL skills, security policies and&amp;nbsp;applications with extreme performance. &amp;nbsp;Oracle Database 19c introduces the following features to make this support even better:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enhanced Information Lifecycle Management with&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/vldbg/manage_hypt.html#GUID-ACBDB3B2-0A16-4CFD-8FF1-A57C9B3D907F&quot;>Hybrid Partitioned Tables</a>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;a single partitioned table can now source data from both Oracle data files and external stores (object storage, hive, HDFS and local text files). &amp;nbsp;Store the external data in native big data formats (parquet, orc, csv, avro, etc.) - enabling that data to be shared with Spark and other data lake applications</li>
	<li><a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/inmem/populating-objects-in-memory.html#GUID-37E2E218-33A2-490E-891D-B627906DE16B&quot;>In-Memory External Tables</a>: &amp;nbsp;load frequently accessed external data in-memory to dramatically improve performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Core Big Data SQL reader functionality for object storage has also been enhanced - offering support for new sources, file types and complex columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ORC columnar file type support has been added to existing parquet, avro and text file support</li>
	<li>Complex data types (e.g. arrays, records, etc.) can now be queried using JSON functions</li>
	<li>Vastly improved support for text file attributes&amp;nbsp;</li>
	<li>Azure Blob Storage added to existing Oracle Object Storage and Amazon S3 support</li>
</ul>

<p>Apache Kafka support has also been enhanced with Oracle SQL Access to Kafka. &amp;nbsp;This new capability removes the requirement for the Oracle Kafka hive storage handler and provides a more systematic approach to querying Kafka streams.</p>

<p>Enjoy the new release!</p>

						<p>The service level agreement for ADB has just been published and it applies only to the deployment of an Autonomous Database on shared infrastructure.</p>

						<p>The pillar document listed below in the section headed <strong>LEARN</strong> states that:</p>

						<p class=&quot;basic_text&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:30px; margin-right:50px;&quot;><em>Oracle will use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure &amp;ndash; Autonomous Database Services on Shared Infrastructure with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95% during any calendar month (the &amp;quot;Service Commitment&amp;quot;). </em></p>

						<p>In the event an Autonomous Database Service on Shared Infrastructure does not meet the &amp;quot;Service Commitment&amp;quot; then customers will be eligible to receive Service Credits. Note - there are specific definitions of key terms in the pillar document (<em>listed below in the section headed <strong>LEARN</strong></em>) that you should read and understand.</p>

						<span style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot;>NEW </span><span class=&quot;feature_header&quot;> - Per-Second Billing For Autonomous Database</span>
						<p>Autonomous Database instance CPU and storage usage is now billed by the second, with a minimum usage period of one minute. Previously Autonomous Database billed in one-hour minimum increments and partial usage of an hour was rounded up to a full hour.</p>

						<p>This change benefits the following types of use cases:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Where you only run your ADB instances during work hours and stop instances at end of working day</li>
							<li>Where you start-stop your instances to run overnight batch jobs</li>
							<li>Where you have ADB instances which typically have a short lifecycle &amp;ndash; sandboxes, QA, training, integration testing instances.</li>
						</ul>

						&amp;nbsp;
						<p>Autonomous Database now supports loading and using Simple Oracle Document Architecture (SODA) documents and collections. SODA allows developers to store, search, and retrieve document collections, typically JSON documents, without using SQL.</p>

						<p>It is possible to also access document collections with SQL/JSON operators which means that ADB now combines the simplicity of a <em>document database</em> with the power of a relational database.</p>

						<p>The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console has been updated with a link to access the SODA drivers for several languages and frameworks including: Java, Node.js, Python, Oracle Call Interface, and PL/SQL, as shown below.</p>

						<p>13 May 2020 at 12:00 PM ET</p>

						<p>Join our Global Leaders webinar to hear from Frank Hoogendoorn, CDO of MineSense: a technology solution provider for the Mining Industry that combines IoT and machine learning to create &amp;quot;Smart Shovel&amp;quot; technologies that optimize mine operations, all powered by Oracle solutions!</p>

						<p>In this Webinar, Frank will explain how MineSense has transitioned from &amp;quot;start-up&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;scale-up&amp;quot;, and how Autonomous Data Warehouse with built-in APEX is enabling rapid business growth with international Mining customers that include some of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest Copper and Zinc producers. Backed by APEX and ADW, their disruptive &amp;lsquo;smart shovel&amp;rsquo; technology collects and analyzes orebody data in real-time, where machine learning based algorithms drive processing decisions to boost mine productivity while reducing energy consumption, all of which leads to more sustainable mining operations. With the flexibility and low cost setup of ADW, the ease of application development and deployment with APEX, and superb on-demand data processing performance, MineSense will talk about how Oracle Solutions, (some even running right on mining shovels!), have been key in setting up a pivotal digital platform, where IT is no longer seen as a business cost but rather a key driver for growth.</p>

            <title>The simplest guide to exporting data from Autonomous Database directly to Object Storage</title>
            <link>https://blogs.oracle.com/datawarehousing/the-simplest-guide-to-exporting-data-from-autonomous-database-directly-to-object-storage</link>
            <description><p>One of the best ways&amp;nbsp;to export data out of your&amp;nbsp;Autonomous Database (ADB), whether to transfer data to a database lying in a different region or even keep a copy of the data in a single place for other teams in your&amp;nbsp;organization to access, is via Oracle&amp;nbsp;Data Pump. Recently we released a much requested feature enabling the ability to export data from your ADB Instance directly to your <a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/cloud/storage/object-storage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Oracle Object Storage</a> bucket.</p>

<p>For this walkthrough, I assume you have:&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ol style=&quot;margin-left: 40px;&quot;>
	<li>A Oracle Cloud Account (<a href=&quot;https://myservices.us.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/signup?sourceType=_ref_coc-asset-opcSignIn&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Sign Up</a>&amp;nbsp;for a trial if you don&amp;#39;t have one.&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s totally free!)</li>
	<li>An Autonomous Database Instance with some data in it (Follow Labs 1 &amp;amp; 3 in <a href=&quot;http://oracle.com/goto/adw/tutorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>this ADB Workshop</a> if you don&amp;#39;t have one)</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have <a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/cloud/sign-in.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>logged in</a> to your Oracle Cloud account with an ADB Instance, lets dive right in to&amp;nbsp;these steps below to export your data.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<a name=&quot;step1&quot;></a>

Step 1: Create an Object Storage bucket

<p>Using the hamburger menu on the left, navigate to your&amp;nbsp;Object Storage. <strong>Select a compartment</strong> which you would like to put your data in and hit &amp;quot;Create Bucket&amp;quot;. The default options work well; In the popup, enter a <u>bucket name</u>&amp;nbsp;(we will use &amp;#39;examplebucket&amp;#39;)&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;continue on to&amp;nbsp;create the bucket . This bucket will hold your exported dump files.</p>

<img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/8f523b221be5b9cb4bf1a9cb29919ae3/screen_shot_2020_04_09_at_6_11_28_pm.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 1000px; height: 378px;&quot; />

<p><span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Note</span>: Data Pump Export supports both OCI Object Storage and OCI Classic Object Storage.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

Step 2: Create a Credential: Authorization between your ADB instance and Object Storage

<p>You will need to<strong> generate&amp;nbsp;an auth token</strong>&amp;nbsp;password for a new credential, navigate the left side menu to <span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Identity -&amp;gt; Users -&amp;gt; Your User</span>. In your selected user, on the bottom left, you will see &amp;quot;Auth Tokens&amp;quot;. When clicked, you will see an option generate a token. Note it down somewhere secure, since you cannot view this later.</p>

<p><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/c52a8a504c5177d50841d7cd9fed595d/generate_token.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 1000px; height: 721px;&quot; /></p>

<p><span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Note</span>:&amp;nbsp;You must use a Swift auth token based credential here, and cannot use an OCI&amp;nbsp;native Signing Key credential.</p>

<p><strong>Navigate to your existing Autonomous Database instance </strong>(it may be ADW or ATP)&amp;nbsp;via the left-hand menu. In your instance&amp;#39;s console,&amp;nbsp;go to&amp;nbsp;the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; tab and&amp;nbsp;navigate to SQL Developer Web. Login with your <strong>ADMIN Database User</strong>.</p>

<p>Copy the following script, in your worksheet. Fill in your <strong>Cloud User</strong>&amp;#39;s username and Auth Token as password, and run it to create your user credential.</p>
BEGIN<br />
&amp;nbsp; DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL(<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; credential_name =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;EXPORT_CRED&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; username =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;someone@oracle.com&amp;#39;,<br />
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; password =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;erioty6434900z&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;#39;<br />
&amp;nbsp; );<br />
END;

&amp;nbsp;

Step 3: Set your credential as the Default Credential (for Data Pump v19.6 and below)

<p>Next, in SQL Developer Web,&amp;nbsp;run the following command after replacing in&amp;nbsp;your database user:</p>
ALTER DATABASE PROPERTY SET DEFAULT_CREDENTIAL = &amp;#39;&amp;lt;Database User Name&amp;gt;.EXPORT_CRED&amp;#39;

<p>You have now set&amp;nbsp;your database&amp;#39;s default credential.</p>

<p><span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Note</span>: I am assuming here you are running Data Pump version 19.6 or below since that is what is currently available on most platforms.&amp;nbsp;In versions 19.7 and above, you will not need to set a default credential and be able to <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/export-data-object-store-newdp.html#GUID-7EE2B6BF-5DF3-43E7-8CA3-1FE5DC13FA1D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>run your exports with a credential parameter</a>!</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

Step 4: Install Oracle Data Pump

<p>If you&amp;#39;re ahead in&amp;nbsp;the game&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;already have a recent installation of Oracle Data Pump, skip to Step 5.&amp;nbsp;If not,&amp;nbsp;the easiest method to install Data Pump is via Instant Client. Download that as well as&amp;nbsp;the Tools Package, which includes Oracle Data Pump, for your platform from&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud&amp;amp;id=instant-client-download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Oracle Instant Client Downloads</a>. Follow the&amp;nbsp;<a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/r-enterprise/1.5.1/oread/installing-oracle-database-instant-client.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>documentation</a>&amp;nbsp;for step-by-step installation details.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

Step 5: Run Oracle Data Pump Export

<p>The&amp;nbsp;Data Pump utility is standalone from the database. Once installed, in&amp;nbsp;your terminal / command line we will&amp;nbsp;run <a href=&quot;#exportcommand&quot;>the&amp;nbsp;command below</a>. Notice, we are using the &amp;quot;default_credential&amp;quot; from Step 3 as the first argument in the &amp;#39;dumpfile&amp;#39; parameter.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The second argument is pointing to your&amp;nbsp;Object Storage bucket&amp;#39;s URI. You may use a Swift URI if you have one,&amp;nbsp;instead of an OCI Native URI as is in the example below.&amp;nbsp;In this&amp;nbsp;URI, replace the:</p>

<ol>
	<li>&amp;lt;region ID&amp;gt; with the <strong>region</strong> you are using. You can identify this by looking at the top right corner of your Oracle Cloud page. Go into &amp;quot;Manage&amp;nbsp;Regions&amp;quot; or look at <a href=&quot;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>this page</a> to get your region&amp;#39;s identifier.</li>
	<li>&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt; with <strong>Object Storage&amp;nbsp;namespace</strong>. This can be found in&amp;nbsp;<span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Profile -&amp;gt; Tenancy&amp;nbsp;</span>(top right corner of the Oracle Cloud page). Look for your &amp;quot;Object Storage Namespace&amp;quot;, it may be the same as your tenancy name or a different ID.</li>
</ol>

<p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/3d08aab347f1723f811951c6c66298d3/screen_shot_2020_04_12_at_5_27_26_pm.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 293px;&quot; /></p>

<p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/fa35ce0b6381749a58a7eaf1ec31c02d/screen_shot_2020_04_12_at_5_27_57_pm.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px; height: 295px;&quot; /></p>

<p>​​​​​</p>

<p>Here we used the bucket name &amp;quot;examplebucket&amp;quot;, if you used a different bucket&amp;nbsp;name also&amp;nbsp;replace that&amp;nbsp;in the URI. With encryption enabled, you will be prompted for a password.&amp;nbsp;For more information on the export parameters and&amp;nbsp;file size limits have a look at <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-data-warehouse-cloud/user/export-data-object-store-dp.html#GUID-9D1768A7-9FDE-448D-9925-C85FD48383E6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>the documentation</a>.</p>
<a name=&quot;exportcommand&quot;> </a> expdp admin/password@ADWC1_high \ 
filesize=5GB \
dumpfile=default_credential:https://objectstorage.&amp;lt;regionID&amp;gt;.oraclecloud.com/n/&amp;lt;namespace&amp;gt;/b /examplebucket/o/exampleexport%U.dmp \
parallel=16 \
encryption_pwd_prompt=yes \
logfile=export.log \
directory=data_pump_dir

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>Of course, depending on the size of your database, this&amp;nbsp;database export can take minutes or hours.</p>

&amp;nbsp;

Final Step &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Thoughts

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>That&amp;#39;s a wrap! Once completed successfully, you can navigate back to your Object Storage bucket we created in <a href=&quot;#step1&quot;>Step 1</a>&amp;nbsp;and you will see your newly exported dump files. The file names begin with &amp;quot;exampleexport&amp;quot;. Since exporting to object store uses <a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/controlling-your-cloud-uploading-large-files-to-oracle-object-storage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>chunks</a>&amp;nbsp;for optimum performance, you may see additional files other&amp;nbsp;than your dump &amp;quot;.dmp&amp;quot; files in your bucket. Don&amp;#39;t delete&amp;nbsp;them, but you&amp;nbsp;may ignore them and should only have to&amp;nbsp;interact with your dump files to access your data.</p>

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;><img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.app.compendium.com/uploads/user/e7c690e8-6ff9-102a-ac6d-e4aebca50425/f3971c04-8bd4-4efa-a5e3-1af82fc8a9ca/Image/53a55971f9a1686c3dd61d6a2eb132dd/screen_shot_2020_04_12_at_6_14_11_pm.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 623px;&quot; /></p>

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;><span style=&quot;color:#c0392b;&quot;>Note</span>: If you followed this guide to a T&amp;nbsp;but are seeing an authorization or a&amp;nbsp;URI not found error, you (or your Cloud Admin) may need to <a href=&quot;https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Reference/objectstorage_security.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>grant object storage access</a> to your Cloud User or Group.</p>

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>Here, we looked at exporting your data to the object store&amp;nbsp;using the popular&amp;nbsp;Data Pump utility running on your&amp;nbsp;machine or server, which makes for&amp;nbsp;a simple workflow to include in your data pipeline.</p>

<p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>In coming weeks, we will also support running Data Pump import/export&amp;nbsp;(using <a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/et_dp_driver.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>the ORACLE_DATAPUMP&amp;nbsp;driver</a>) from within the database using your&amp;nbsp;PL/SQL scripts using DBMS_CLOUD, so keep your eyes peeled for more Data Pump goodness! ?</p>

						<span style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot;>NEW </span><span class=&quot;feature_header&quot;> - Upgrade an Autonomous Database Instance to Oracle Database 19c</span>
						<p>Oracle Database 19c is now available on Autonomous Database for all regions. In select regions, customers can choose between Oracle Database 18c and Oracle Database 19c for new databases. The default version for all new databases is 19c and going forward, most new Autonomous Database features will only be available for databases using Oracle Database 19c.</p>

						<p>Please start planning for the upgrade of your applications to Database 19c. For most applications, there should not be any changes required. However, it is recommended you should test your applications with Database 19c. You can easily test your applications by creating a clone of your current database to Oracle Database 19c, and testing your application using this clone.</p>

						<p>Oracle Database 18c is scheduled to be available in Autonomous Database until September 2020.</p>

						<p>You can choose to upgrade your database at any time during this period. After that time, all existing databases will be automatically upgraded to Oracle Database 19c. There are several approaches to upgrading your database which are described in the documentation, see links below.</p>

						<p><strong>Note:</strong> Autonomous Database plans to offer a new upgrade path starting in April, with a single button that provides a one-way, in-place upgrade.</p>
