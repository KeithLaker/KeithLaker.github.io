				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Analytics view is a new type of view that organizes tables into business models with aggregate data, measures calculations, and provides a rich presentation metadata layer. Analytics views, which are easily queried using SQL and MDX, provide an enhanced data foundation for business intelligence tools and Excel pivot tables. Analytics View Express is analytics view-based application that allows business users to easily layer a business model over data and immediately query using a rich set of data visualizations. In this session learn how to transform a plain set of Oracle tables into a rich business model and collection of data visualizations. This session is geared for BI application developers, data architects, and business users.	<br><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Database operations account for the larger part of applications performance and scalability. Java applications that use an RDBMS must follow known best practices, consider database proxies, and embrace asynchronous database access using reactive and functional programming. This session revisits the known best practices for speeding up database connectivity, speeding up SQL statements processing, optimizing network traffic, and in-place processing. The session also covers scaling out Java applications workload using sharded databases, multitenant databases, database proxy, and the upcoming asynchronous Java database access API. This new API proposal is an entirely separate API that provides completely nonblocking access to databases.	<br><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	High-performing machine learning algorithms come packaged in Oracle Big Data Cloud Service and Oracle Big Data Cloud at Customer. In this session learn how to interface with data lakes and large datasets using the Oracle Big Data manager UI, which contains a zeppelin notebook interface. Discover how this allows for the use of SQL queries and the R language to manipulate data from an object store and HDFS, HIVE, and IMPALA tables, and it can also be used to create machine learning algorithms using Spark and graph computations using Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph—all from one simple interface.	<br><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Using way too much electricity and not quite sure where? Tracking usage is a great start, but analyzing data is easiest in a database. Building on the "Watch me make a Watt-watcher" project, this session begins with an overview of the steps and components used to assemble the hardware. Data ingestion to an Oracle Database Cloud is made straight forward with the Python cx_Oracle driver. Get an overview of other cx_Oracle features useful to IoT projects as well, and come away with the tools to track the data in your own projects and hopefully some new ideas. (But no electrical burns!).	<br><br>
