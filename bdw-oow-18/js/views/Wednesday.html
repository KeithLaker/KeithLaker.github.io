				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Data platforms are becoming increasingly complex. Kafka is widely used for real-time stream processing. Data lakes are persisting massive volumes of historical and unstructured data. Oracle Databases capture the critical information required to run your business. Each data store contains valuable data, yet insights are achieved by correlating queries across these stores. In this session learn how Oracle Big Data SQL easily enables these insights, leveraging your existing investment in applications and skillsets while keeping information safe using Oracle’s advanced security policies.	<br><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	SmartDB lets just two teams build an OLTP application. One team exposes the database as a hard-shell PL/SQL API defined as JSON in/JSON out functions. The other program is a modern browser-based UI in JavaScript. Oracle REST Data Services acts as the semantics-free (and therefore maintenance-free) protocol adapter between Oracle Net Services and REST. The carefully designed API contract brings minimum coupling between modules, letting the two teams work independently. In particular, each can fix its bugs without talking to the other. This session shows you how to use edition-based redefinition to fix bugs in the hard-shell implementation with zero downtime, and flip end-user sessions to the patched version from inside the database. Only SmartDB can implement the flip for every server call.	<br><br>

				<p class="oj-p" style="font-size:20px;">	Too often, a product selection benefits either IT or the business, but not both. Great visualization tools are popular with business analysts yet they represent corporate risk and a nonstrategic direction for IT. On the other hand, platform technologies that IT recognizes as having value may have little impact or even hinder the business consumer’s daily duties. Why can’t there be a single solution? Autonomous analytics brings value to both IT and the business. Autonomous administration/management saves IT costs and frees resources.
