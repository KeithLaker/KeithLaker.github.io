# Welcome to Oracle MovieStream

Oracle MovieStream is a fictitious on-line movie streaming company. Customers log into Oracle MovieStream using their computers, tablets and phones where they are presented with a targeted list of movies based on their past viewing habits. The company is now looking for better, smarter ways to track performance, identifying customers to target with campaigns that promote new services, new movies and new viewing platforms. Many of the scenarios in this workshop will very likely match the challenges you are seeing in your business and we hope the following labs and accompanying workshops will give you some insight into how Oracle can help you solve these common everyday business and technical challenges.

This is the type of person that typically "owns" the data warehouse or data mart. They are tasked with loading new sales data every day and they typically write their own adhoc SQL reports to spot trends. This person has some technical knowledge of SQL but is not an Oracle Database expert. They will use the common SQL tools to help them create reports and extract data based requirements from the business teams.
</td>

This persona typically prepares the quarterly sales analysis briefings for senior management. Their role is similar to that of a data analyst. This person is familiar with using tools such as Excel. Their quarterly analysis aims to highlight outliers and anomalies within data to senior management. They will be compfortable using a wide range of zero-code tools to simplify and speedup the delivery of their reports and dashboards. 
</td>
<td valign="top">
This persona is comfortable using SQL and PL/SQL and is looking to explore new data analysis techniques such as machine learning, gaph analytics and spatial analytics. They prefer to use tools and services that offer high levels of automatation for analytical workflows. They need to quickly and easily create new analytical models that can help other users understand relationships, predict future outomes and identify patterns in their data sets.
